Given the rising levels of uncertainty during the COVID 19 pandemic, and highly competitive pureplay landscape, agility has been cited as a meritorious organizational trait particularly in fast-paced tech companies, to navigate changing consumer demands within a limited frame of time (Kotler, Kartajaya and Setiawan, 2021). From staying ahead of the latest trends, to personalizing the user journey with real time contextual updates, or even rapidly experimenting with content, agility has become an integral part of keeping pace with changing consumer preferences.
This study aims to investigate the effects of Agile Marketing Capabilities of multibrand fashion apps on the repurchase intentions of Gen Zs and younger Millennials, particularly accentuating on the intermediary role of consumer’s affective states – pleasure, arousal, and dominance. Pureplay multibrand fashion apps refer to mobile platforms used by e-tailers such as ASOS and ZALANDO offering a plethora of brands under one umbrella. Equipped with mobility and rich data from the user’s device, fashion apps provide an ideal context to study the effects of agile marketing on consumer behaviour./n

Drawing on Mehrabian and Russell’s (1974) theory of environmental psychology, this research builds on the Stimulus-Organism-Response and Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance frameworks to infer casual links between agile marketing capabilities of fashion apps, consumers’ emotional states, and repurchase behaviour. In doing so, the study addresses limitations articulated in existing academia regarding lack of empirical research on agile strategies from a consumer perspective. Moreover, despite the growing number of users, fashion apps are still struggling with consumer retention due to emerging competitors and the increasing concerns around data privacy. Therefore, this study also adds to extant literature on app marketing by emphasizing on drivers of app usage continuance. In addition, this research particularly focuses on pureplay multibrand fashion apps in the UAE, as both pureplay multibrand fashion apps and the region of interest have received little attention in existing fashion academia.
The research adopts a positivist philosophy using mono-method deductive approach to validate hypotheses developed from theory. It further analyzes the data collected from an online questionnaire using statistical software to report empirical findings./n

The novelty of this research stems from its context and is also observed in its key findings. This study illustrates the significance of feelings of dominance and arousal compared to feelings of pleasure, as the main determinants of repurchase intentions in fashion apps. It also demonstrates how agile cues such as newness of assortment and platform transparency act as precursors of such emotions. The study further uses such empirical findings to develop a conceptual model contributing to existing literature on fashion apps and agile marketing and provides strategic recommendations for app marketers to enhance app usage continuance./n
